    "\n",
    "In this section, we will do some preprocessings on the environment. Basically our work consists of wrapping our environment around three wrappers. You should implement each of these wrappers in the `src/wrappers.py` file provided to you in the assignment folder. \n",
    "* Reducing image input size: The Atari game given as input has high resolution which is definitely not needed for the model and it can learn efficiently without all of the additional data. These additional pixels create overhead. We can thus save a lot of time by preprocessing game image, including:\n",
    "    - Resizing to a smaller shape, (84 x 84 recommended for the Breakout and 50 x 50 recommended for ShootNDodge)\n",
    "    - Converting to grayscale (Not recommended for ShootNDodge)\n",
    "    - Cropping irrelevant image parts (top, bottom and edges)\n",
    "    - Also please keep one dimension for channel even if the image is grayscale so that final shape would be (H x W x C)\n",
    "* Reward clipping: There might be the case that many of the RL problems have unstable rewards. In case the rewards are not continuous with respect to the state space, then the local optimization methods used for learning the network will fall short. To address this issue we create a wrapper around our original environment - Note that this is not a necessity and in case you feel comfortable with the rewards given in the original environment, then your wrapper should simply return the previous values as if nothing has heppened! Feel free to accumulate more knowledge about reward clipping where we reduce the range of the rewards to [-1, 1]. In case you observe increasing gradient norms in the learning process, then it would be good to consider this method.\n",
    "* Remove Blinking: Since we resize the image, we might come accross blinking whereas in one frame a certain thing is visible, but at the split-frame afterward, it fades and then returns again. To remove this issue we introduce a `MaxAndSkipEnv` in which we skip one frame and each frame's intensity will be equal to the maximum of the previous frame and itself. A preliminary code is implemented in the `wrappers.py` file.\n",
    "* Episodic life: In case of *Breakout* losing takes 5 lives. To increase the chance of the model learning, we may end the game whenever one single life is lost.\n",
    "* Starting the game: In case of *Breakout* one should take a particular action to start the game. For example, they might need to press the `space` key in order for the game to start rolling. A wrapper is implemented to forcefully enter the game start action in the beginning. Indeed, in case this wrapper is not implemented, the agent can learn to take that action to gain higher reward; however, this will make the training time even longer."

    "This aint no supervised learning so don't expect anything to improve monotonously. \n",
    "* **TD loss** is the MSE between agent's current Q-values and target Q-values. It may slowly increase or decrease, it's ok. The \"not ok\" behavior includes going NaN or stayng at exactly zero before agent has perfect performance.\n",
    "* **grad norm** just shows the intensivity of training. Not ok is growing to values of about 100 (or maybe even 50) though it depends on network architecture.\n",
    "* **mean reward** is the expected sum of r(s,a) agent gets over the full game session. It will oscillate, but on average it should get higher over time (after a few thousand iterations...). \n",
    " * In basic q-learning implementation it takes about 40k steps to \"warm up\" agent before it starts to get better.\n",
    "* **Initial state V** is the expected discounted reward for episode in the oppinion of the agent. It should behave more smoothly than **mean reward**. It should get higher over time but sometimes can experience drawdowns because of the agaent's overestimates.\n",
    "* **buffer size** - this one is simple. It should go up and cap at max size.\n",
    "* **epsilon** - agent's willingness to explore. If you see that agent's already at 0.01 epsilon before it's average reward is above 0 - it means you need to increase epsilon. Set it back to some 0.2 - 0.5 and decrease the pace at which it goes down.\n",
    "* Smoothing of plots is done with a gaussian kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "At first your agent will lose quickly. Then it will learn to suck less and at least hit the ball a few times before it loses. Finally it will learn to actually score points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training will take time.** A lot of it actually. Probably you will not see any improvment during first **150k** time steps (note that by default in this notebook agent is evaluated every 5000 time steps)."
